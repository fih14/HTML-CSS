        <h3 id="headline">Louis Pasteur's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1822</strong> - Born in Dole, France.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1845</strong> - Receives the <em>licencié ès sciences</em> degree at the <em>École Normale Supérieure</em> in Paris, France.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1848</strong> - Resolves a problem concerning the nature of tartaric acid. (Molecular assymetry)
            He observes that, in racemic mixtures of tartrates, half of the crystals were right-handed (dextrorotatory) and half were left-handed (levorotatory). 
           </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1858</strong> - Demostrates, in alcoholic fermentation,  that yeast was responsible for fermentation to produce alcohol from sugar.
          </li>
          <li><strong>1861</strong> - Observes that sugar fermented per part of yeast when the yeast was exposed to air.
            The lower rate of fermentation aerobically became known as the Pasteur effect.
          </li>
          <li><strong>1862</strong> - Disproves the the Doctrine of Spontaneous Generation.
          He placed boiled liquid in a flask and let hot air enter the flask. Then he closed the flask, and no organisms grew in it
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1865</strong> - Inventes a process in which liquids are heated to a temperature between 60 and 100 °C. This killed most bacteria and moulds already present within them.
            The method became known as pasteurization, and was soon applied to beer and milk.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1866</strong> - Publishes <em>Etudes sur le Vin</em>, about the diseases of wine.
          </li>

          <strong>1867</strong> - Achieves an effective process to stop infections in  Silkworm disease.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1876</strong> - Publishes <em>Etudes sur la Bière</em>, concerning the diseases of beer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1877</strong> - First work on vaccine development was on chicken cholera.
            It was not regular in its effects and was a failure. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1881</strong> - Vaccination against anthrax. He had not used attenuation, but secretly used Toussaint's technique, and was criticized by Koch and other colleagues.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1885</strong> - Uses the vaccine for rabies on 9-year-old Joseph Meister after the boy was badly mauled by a rabid dog.
            Over 11 days, Meister received 13 inoculations, each inoculation using viruses that had been weakened for a shorter period of time.            
          </li>
          <li><strong>1888</strong> - Institute Pasteur opens in Paris.</li>
          <li><strong>1892</strong> - Jubilee celebrations at the Soborne.</li>
